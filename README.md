# Marketing Page Template 

![Template Screenshot](assets/images/template_screenshot.png)

## Description

This marketing template uses semantic elements for better accessibility and readability. In addition to improving search results, these tags also reduce the number of classes needed to style various parts of the page, making the css file much easier to read as well. In the code snippet below, the two style layouts, before their accessibility tags, used very specific, long class names to help the reader identify what the code was styling on the page. With the element changes, some idea of where these styles affect the page can be determined, without even referring to the html code (which is often not possible with class names).

```css

article {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    padding: 50px;
    height: 300px;
    font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
    background-color: #0072bb;
    color: #ffffff;
}

aside {
    margin-right: 20px;
    padding: 20px;
    clear: both;
    float: right;
    width: 20%;
    height: 100%;
    font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
    background-color: #2589bd;
}
```
